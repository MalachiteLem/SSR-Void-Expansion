A WIP fan-port of Void content and some more things from mod Starstorm by NK for Risk of Rain (2013) to Risk of Rain Returns.

HUGE thanks/credits to:

Beebo - Original sprite of Seraph in ssrcord, used as a base for literally every sprite

TRYAGAIN, Azuline, Kris and a few other people (I forgot who exactly, really sorry about that) - coding help. I cooked spaghetti.

TangoKnight, Winslow, Beebo - inspired by their spriting work a lot. Tried to learn rorr spriting based off of their works while working on things other than Seraph. If it wasn't for them, I would've probably never tried my hand at this again

Fox, Goobessa, qwp, Wertus, Nilzer and a handful others - supportive and kind words during my time working on this

And everyone else who was involved in any way with this!

Planned first release: November 5th, if things go smooth
